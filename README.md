DESCRIPTION

This Python script, article_summarizer.py, is a simple tool that automatically summarizes long articles using artificial intelligence. It uses the Hugging Face transformers library, specifically the pipeline function with a built-in summarization model. When run, it takes a long piece of text (in this case, a sample about artificial intelligence), feeds it into the summarizer, and prints both the original and the summarized versions. The function summarize_article() allows you to set the desired length of the summary using max_length and min_length. This makes the script flexible, so you can control how brief or detailed the summary should be. The model used is pre-trained, so it works right out of the box without needing any additional setup or training. It's perfect for students, writers, or anyone who wants to quickly condense long articles into short, easy-to-read summaries. The script runs from the command line and is very lightweight, making it suitable even on machines without GPUs.
